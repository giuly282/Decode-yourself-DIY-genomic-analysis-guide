# 🧪 Chapter 1: Key Concepts – The Language of Life (Decoded)

## 🧬 What is a Genome?

Your genome is the complete instruction manual for building and maintaining “you.”  
Roughly 3.2 billion base pairs long, 20,000-odd genes, and a whole lot of non-coding content (yes, that infamous “junk DNA”—which turns out not to be junk at all).

It’s not a blueprint. It’s more like a weather forecast written in probability and molecular chaos.

## 🧬 Genotype vs. Phenotype

- **Genotype** = your genetic makeup (what’s in the code)  
- **Phenotype** = what actually shows up (height, eye color, disease risks)

Your genome is not destiny. It's possibility—influenced by environment, randomness, and good old-fashioned luck.

## 🧬 Variants, Not Errors

Your genome is 99.9% identical to everyone else’s.  
But that 0.1%? That's where things get interesting. And dangerous. And deeply personal.

Key types of genetic variation:

- **SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)** – One-letter changes. Common. Often harmless. Sometimes not.  
- **INDELs (Insertions and Deletions)** – Can disrupt a gene like a typo in a recipe.  
- **CNVs (Copy Number Variants)** – Repeated or missing chunks of DNA. Think of them as genetic stutters or stammers.

## 🧬 The Central Dogma (with a Twist)

You might remember this from high school:

DNA → RNA → Protein
🧬 Ethics & Data Sensitivity

Your genetic data is not “just data.”
It’s *you*. It’s your *family*. It’s your *potential future children*.
Handle with precision, paranoia, and principle.

* Don’t upload raw files to random sites.
* Don’t treat predictions as prophecies.
* Don’t interpret alone what you can’t emotionally or technically process.


# 🧫 How Biology Becomes Data

Your genome isn’t just sitting in a USB stick somewhere-it starts in your cells, wet and wild.
To analyse it, we need to **digitise biology**, translating molecules into machine-readable code.
This is the messy, magnificent pipeline that turns blood into bits.

Let’s break it down.

## 🧬 Step 1: Sample Collection – The Body Offers Its Code

Usually saliva or blood. You give a biological sample. Simple, but sacred.
That sample contains cells. Those cells contain DNA.
Boom—you just handed over 3 billion letters of deeply personal code.

## 🧪 Step 2: Sequencing – Reading the Letters

The DNA is extracted, fragmented, and run through a sequencing machine.
It doesn’t “read” DNA like a book—it shreds it and **reconstructs it digitally**, one chaotic puzzle piece at a time.

* **Output**: `FASTQ` files – long text files filled with A, T, C, G, and confidence scores.
* **Platforms**: Illumina (short-read), Oxford Nanopore (long-read, real-time).

This is raw data. Beautiful. Noisy. Useless—until cleaned.

## 🔍 Step 3: Alignment – Contextualising the Chaos

Your raw reads are now aligned to a **reference genome** (like hg38), much like pinning shredded pages to a complete book and guessing where they go.

* **Tools**: `BWA`, `Bowtie2` – open-source, peer-reviewed, hardcore.
* **Output**: `BAM` files – aligned reads, binary format. Big files. Precision-coded.

## 🧬 Step 4: Variant Calling – Spot the Difference

Now the software scans your aligned genome and flags differences compared to the reference. These are your **variants**.

* **Tools**: `GATK`, `FreeBayes`, `bcftools`
* **Output**: `VCF` files (Variant Call Format) – lists of changes:

  > “This base here? You’ve got a T, most people have a C.”

Some are harmless. Some are interesting. A few might change your life.

## 🧠 Step 5: Annotation – Making Sense of It All

A raw variant is meaningless without context. We need to ask:

* Is it in a gene?
* Does it change a protein?
* Has it been seen before in ClinVar, gnomAD, or 1000 Genomes?

**Tools**: `SnpEff`, `VEP`, `ANNOVAR`

Now we move from data to **hypothesis**. From probability to *maybe* insight.

## ⚠️ Reality Check: This is Not a Straight Line

In academia, pipelines break. Files corrupt. Databases change.
You’ll hit bugs. You’ll misread results. That’s normal.

This is science—**not a service**.
You’re not buying answers. You’re building your own questions.
